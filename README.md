- âš¡ Fun fact: ...Did you know that the first computer bug was an actual bug? In 1947, engineers working on the Harvard Mark II computer found a moth trapped in one of the relays, causing the computer to malfunction. They removed the moth and taped it into the logbook, noting it as the "first actual case of bug being found." This is where the term "debugging" comes from!
